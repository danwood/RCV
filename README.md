This is the iOS app front end for the [https://github.com/rankchoice/rankchoice](https://github.com/rankchoice/rankchoice) back-end project, as presented at 2019 [Developer Camp](https://devca.mp).

Like any product of a hackathon, the code is *not* production ready. For instance there is liberal use of the swift `!` which I normally eschew.

So consider it a proof of concept. A single link among a much more complicated chain.

This is open-source — oh yeah, we got the [award for best open-source project](https://twitter.com/sujamthe/status/1092254049175392256) — MIT style.
